Hello, this is CS22A course.
DeAnza College
Fall Quarter.
This file has four text lines.

Line number one.
This is another line; number two.
A third line is added.
Now, we have four lines.
But this is a longer file.
So, we made it six lines.

This is your first C++ assignment.  The main purpose of this assignment is to make sure you are set to go in this class and know how to write a simple hello code and compile.

The program should write a short letter to me like:

My name is Fred Flintstone, and I am in high school/college/etc  any info you like to tell about yourself such as work, hobbies, etc.

You can use many cout <<  statements; one for each line and end the line with << endl;

4. Submit hello_main.cpp; you can include the output if you like by storing it in a file hello_out.txt (optional).

Example: file hello.cpp

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(void)
{
    cout << "Hello Students!" << endl;
    cout << "Welcome to DeAnza College Class CIS22A.54Z" << endl

    return 0;

}

You can submit your .cpp file or a link to your solution online

Until I have DeAnza Canvas access, you submit via email to my personal email:
To: hussein.deanza@edu   attache hello.cpp or main.cpp
